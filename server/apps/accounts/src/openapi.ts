 * spec, and the handler stays lenient. That is deliberate — the Rec Room client is the
 * real consumer, form fields are read as `typeof value === 'string' ? value : ''`, and
 * missing or malformed input falls through to a graceful path (or a synthesized default
 * account) rather than a hard error. A schema that rejected what the client actually
 * sends would break the game, not protect it.
 *
 * The EXCEPTION is the profile mutations a player types into a box — displayName,
 * username, email, phone, bio. Those carry real rules (see `@repo/domain`), and each is
 * wired into `hono-openapi`'s `validator()` per route, with tests, exactly as the older
 * version of this note prescribed. Wiring one up means the schema both validates the
 * request and generates the spec, so a limit can't be changed in one and not the other —
 * which is precisely how the documented email limit came to disagree with the real one.
 *
 * A validated route drops `requestBody: form(...)` from its `describeRoute`: the
 * validator registers the body itself, and declaring it twice would emit it twice.
