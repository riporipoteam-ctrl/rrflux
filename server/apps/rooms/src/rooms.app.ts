 * them out afterwards: `match` refuses their matchmakes into this room with `BannedFromRoom`
 * (55). This frame only gets them out of the session they are in right now.
 *
 * It must NOT look like an account ban, and it once did. `IsBan: true` on this frame is what
 * the client's moderation screen reads as a ban from the GAME — it is exactly what the staff
 * account ban (`www`) sends — so a room ban sent that way showed players a game-wide ban
 * screen, and with a non-zero `duration` a timed one, when nothing but one room was closed to
 * them. So, like `api`'s instant kick:
 *
 *  - `isBan` false and `duration` 0. The frame is a kick; the ban is server-side.
 *  - EPHEMERAL, never queued. A queued frame is delivered on the player's next connect, which
 *    would eject them from some unrelated session later, or greet them with it on login.
 *  - Sent only when they were standing in THIS room — `gameSessionId` is the instance they were
 *    evicted from. A player banned from a room they are not in has nothing to be ejected from
 *    and hears nothing; they meet the ban as a refused matchmake if they try to join.
 *
 * The payload is the client's moderation shape, camelCase, in wire order. `isHostKick` says the
 * room's HOST ejected them rather than a room vote-kick; the only false case today is a staff
 * moderator acting in a room they do not host. `playerIdReporter` is whoever caused it.
 *
 * Best-effort: the ban row has already committed, so a hub hiccup must not fail the request.
