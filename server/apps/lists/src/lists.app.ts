 * no storefront sells renders as nothing, indistinguishable from an id the client failed to
 * parse. No skin carries that rarity today, so the clause costs them nothing and stops a future

 * lists an avatar item under as its `PurchasableItemId` — one number resolves a row entity and a
 * store item, with no second numbering between them. It is clear of every captured storefront's
 * own ids by construction (see `CATALOG_ID_BASE`). It is a LOAD-ORDER surrogate, reassigned by
 * every catalog load, which is fine for a row built and consumed within one request but is why
 * nothing may store one.
 *
 * WORTH KNOWING for skins: no generated storefront lists them — sf1704 is avatar items only —
 * so a client handed a skin's id has nothing to resolve it against yet, and the row will draw
 * as nothing until a storefront carries them.
