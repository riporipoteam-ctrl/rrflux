/**
 * A room's leaderboards on the shared `recflare` D1 database: each player's value on each
 * of a room's stat channels.
 *
 * One table, one row per (player, room, channel), created the first time a player posts a
 * stat for that channel of the room via `POST /leaderboard/CheckAndSetStat`. A player with
 * no row is not on that board: the reads answer that as an empty slice or {@link UNRANKED}
 * rather than inserting on a read.
 *
 * A board is a (room, channel) pair — `stat_channel` is the client's `StatChannel`, which of
 * the room's tracked stats this is, and `stat_value` is what it posts as `StatValue`. What a
 * channel counts (wins, laps, a time) is the room's business; the server only orders on it.
 *
 * Ranks are 0-BASED and total: the board is ordered by `stat_value` (highest first unless
 * the client asks for ascending) with ties broken on the lower `player_id`, so two players
 * with the same score never share a rank and a rank is stable between two reads.
 *
 * Zero-based because the client adds one before it draws — it renders `Rank` 0 as "#1", so a
 * `Rank` of 1 shows up in the game as second place. This is the same convention the client's
 * own `GetRanks` body uses: it asks for the first ten rows as `RankStart` 0, `RankEnd` 9.
 *
 * A board can be read through a FRIENDS filter (the client's `FilterType` 1): the same rows
 * restricted to the viewer and the people they are friends with, ranked among themselves —
 * so a player who is 40th globally can be 2nd among friends. Friendship is the `api`
 * worker's `relationship` table on the same database, read here through a subquery rather
 * than an `IN (...)` list so a player with hundreds of friends doesn't hit D1's bind limit.
 *
 * The `leaderboard` worker owns the schema/migrations (migrations/0001_leaderboard.sql,
 * applied under its own `migrations_table` so they don't clash with the other workers'
 * migrations that share the database).
