 * IMPORTANT: these are DESCRIPTIVE ONLY. They are passed to `describeRoute` to generate
 * the spec and are never wired into `hono-openapi`'s `validator()`. Same rationale as the
 * auth/accounts/econ/match workers: a reverse-engineered protocol, lenient handlers, no
 * runtime validation. Here it matters more than usual — three of the four handlers do not
 * parse their bodies at all, and the fourth reads one field, so a body that contradicts the
 * schema below is still answered.
 *
 * Do NOT add `.meta({ id })` to these schemas — with this hono-openapi + zod v4 setup a
 * meta'd schema used in a response emits a `$ref` the framework doesn't always hoist into
 * `components.schemas`, leaving a dangling reference. Leaving meta off makes every schema
 * inline, which renders correctly in any tool.
