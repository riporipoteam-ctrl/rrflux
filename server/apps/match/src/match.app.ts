	// six copies of the same check: a route added later inherits it, and there is no
	// matchmake left that hands a banned player Photon coordinates.
	//
	// `resolveBan` matches the caller's own account AND the accounts they share a proven
	// platform identity or an IP with, so a ban survives the evader making a new account
	// (see bans-db.ts; the operator narrows the linked arms with BAN_EVASION_MATCH). The

	// banned" are very different things to be looking at in a log.

	// It answers the same BannedFromRoom the room bans do. The code is per-room in name
	// only — it's the one refusal the client renders as "you are banned" instead of a room
	// that mysteriously fails to load, and it's what the enum offers.
	//
	// ONE exception: a BLOCKED player may still matchmake into their own DORM.
	// `auth` already issues them a token, because the client has to be signed in to reach
	// `api`'s moderationBlockDetails — the screen that tells them they are banned, for how long
	// and why. Refused every matchmake, the client never finishes loading in and never draws
	// that screen, so a banned player saw nothing but a game that would not start. Their dorm
	// is private to them and reachable by nobody else, so letting them sit in it costs nothing
	// and is where they read the ban. Everything else — every public room, club, event,
	// instance, invite and follow — is still refused, which is the ban.

	// `none` would otherwise hand back whatever instance their presence names, so for a banned
	// caller its handler answers the dorm outright rather than trusting a stale row.
	//
	// Ban EVASION gets the dorm too. `auth` signs those accounts in like any other, so refusing
	// them the dorm would leave the client stuck on load-in — the exact failure this exception
	// exists to fix — and they are held to it by the same gate. They see no block screen (that

/**
 * Cron: sweep presence that has aged past its TTL, then the instances left empty.
 *
 * The presence purge isn't about correctness of `/player` — reads already ignore
 * expired rows. It's that a player who crashed or hard-quit never matchmakes out of
 * their instance, so nothing recomputes that instance's fullness and it can stay
 * flagged full (and unjoinable) with nobody in it. Note the instances the expiring
 * rows point at *before* deleting: the sweep is the only thing that notices those
 * departures.
 *
 * Emptying an instance is what makes it garbage — nothing ever reuses it, and a
 * joiner handed one would land alone in a Photon room everyone left — so the empty
 * sweep runs next. It reads presence without consulting expiry, so it depends on
 * running after the purge above: this order is what makes a lapsed row count as a
 * departure. Fullness is recomputed last, so it works from the final head-count and
 * skips (returns null for) the instances just deleted.
