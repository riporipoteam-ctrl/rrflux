 *
 * That is deliberate, not an oversight. This worker serves a reverse-engineered
 * protocol: the Rec Room client is the only real consumer, and the handlers are
 * intentionally lenient — every field is read as
 * `typeof body.x === 'string' ? body.x : ''` and missing/malformed input falls
 * through to a graceful path rather than a 400. Which parts of that tolerance the
 * client actually depends on is not fully known, so enforcing a schema would risk
 * rejecting requests that work today, for a client that is hard to debug against.
 *
 * So: these schemas record what the client is *observed* to send and what we send
 * back. If you want to enforce one, do it per-route and land a test with it.
