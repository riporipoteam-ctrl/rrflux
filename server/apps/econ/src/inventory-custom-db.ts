/**
 * Owned CUSTOM avatar items on the shared `recflare` D1 database — the custom avatar items
 * (player-made shirts and the imported first-party items alike) a player has bought. One row
 * per (account, item), written by `POST /api/items/bulkpurchase` when a line names an item
 * by `Guid`, and read back by `GET /econ/customAvatarItems/v1/owned`.
 *
 * Only the id is stored: the item record lives in `custom_avatar_item`, whose schema the
 * `api` worker owns (apps/api/src/custom-avatar-items-db.ts) on this same database, and the
 * owned read joins across to serve it whole. A creator is not listed here — they own their
 * item through `CreatorAccountId`, which the owned read folds in and the buy path refuses to
 * sell them — the same arrangement as `inventory_invention`.
 *
 * This worker (`econ`) owns the table and its migration — see apps/econ/migrations/
 * 0023_inventory_custom.sql.
