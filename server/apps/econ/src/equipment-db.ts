 * Owned equipment on the shared `recflare` D1 database — the equipment skins a player
 * has bought from a storefront (e.g. a "Bow Skin (Dryad Summer)"). One row per
 * (account, item): like avatar items, owning a piece of equipment is boolean, so the
 * skin is granted at purchase time (`POST /api/storefronts/v2/buyItem`, when the
 * gift-drop carries an `EquipmentModificationGuid`) and read back by
 * `GET /api/equipment/v2/getUnlocked`.
 *
 * The item is keyed by the gift-drop's equipment guid, so re-buying the same skin
 * upserts rather than piling up duplicate rows (these drops are flagged `Unique`).
 * `data` is the rendered unlocked-equipment DTO, stored opaquely and served back
 * untouched.
 *
 * This worker (`econ`) owns the table and its migration — see apps/econ/migrations/
 * 0006_equipment.sql. The gift box the purchase also creates lives in a separate table
 * (@repo/domain's received_gift); ownership does not depend on the box being opened.
