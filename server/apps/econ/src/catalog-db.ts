/**
 * The item CATALOG on the shared `recflare` D1 database — every avatar item and every
 * equipment skin the game knows about, one row each, loaded once by migration rather than
 * written at runtime. Nothing here is per-player: ownership lives in `inventory` and
 * `equipment`, and this table only says what a thing IS.
 *
 * It exists to be QUERIED. The catalogs were previously reachable only by parsing a whole
 * storefront JSON per request (`sf{N}.json`, 1161 items in sf3 alone) and by scanning the
 * bundled `default-avatar-items.json`, which means every lookup pays for the whole file and
 * nothing can be searched by name or filtered by tag at all. A row with indexes answers those
 * in one statement.
 *
 * BOTH kinds share one table because they share most of a record — a display name, a tooltip, a
 * rarity, a platform mask, a thumbnail — and because the interesting queries ("what is called
 * X", "what is this thing the player owns") run across both. `kind` discriminates, and the
 * columns each kind alone carries are nullable and empty on the other. Read a row through
 * {@link toCatalogAvatarItem}/{@link toCatalogSkin} rather than serving it raw: the client's
 * two DTOs share no key order and differ in what they omit.
 *
 * Where the rows come from: `static/db/avatar-items.json` and `static/db/skins.json`, both
 * captured from the reference and loaded by `runx catalog load`.
 *
 * The migration builds the TABLE ONLY — it holds no rows. The catalog changes as the game's
 * item list changes, and that is not a schema change: a migration per refresh would mean a
 * deploy per refresh, an ever-growing pile of near-identical data migrations, and no way to
 * reload without inventing a new one. So the structure is versioned and the contents are
 * (re)loaded on demand, which also makes a refresh a `git diff` of the JSON rather than of
 * 700KB of generated SQL.
 *
 * This worker (`econ`) owns the table and its migration.

// The discriminator and the JSON→row mapping live in `catalog-load.ts`, which deliberately
// touches no Workers types: `runx catalog load` (a plain Node CLI in @repo/tools) imports it,
// and importing this module instead would drag `D1Database` into a package that has no such
// types. Re-exported here so callers still get the whole table from one import.

/**
 * Schema DDL (mirror of migrations/0015_catalog.sql) — also builds the table in tests.
 *
 * ONE KEY spans both kinds. `item_key` is an avatar item's `AvatarItemDesc` and a skin's
 * `ModificationGuid`: neither repeats, the two never collide, and no item has both. That is
 * also how the INVENTORY identifies what a player owns, so resolving an owned thing is a lookup
 * on this column — not a join that first has to establish which kind of thing it is.
 *
 * Not every key is a GUID. 191 skins and 109 avatar items carry the short alpha-string ids the
 * game used before it moved to GUIDs (`_OWVy3z6iU-M3-zbQgSLig`), so the column is TEXT and
 * compared as text. Do not add a uuid-shaped constraint and do not try to parse one.
 *
 * `avatar_item_id` is carried as DATA ONLY and deliberately not indexed: it is missing from 22
 * avatar items and repeated on 9 more (id 9503 alone covers five unrelated developer items), so
 * it can neither key nor reliably find anything.
 *
 * `catalog_id` is the small NUMERIC handle the site uses where a key would be unwieldy, and is
 * what a generated storefront lists a row under as its `PurchasableItemId`. It is assigned by
 * the loader from `CATALOG_ID_BASE` (10000, clear of every captured storefront's own ids) and
 * renumbered by every load, so it identifies a row only within one load — see the field's own
 * note. It is unique where set, and the migration that adds it is 0016, since 0015 was already
 * applied.
 *
 * Nullability is load-bearing rather than incidental: `tooltip` is genuinely NULL on some rows
 * of BOTH kinds and `""` on others, and the client's DTOs serve the distinction through, so the
 * column may not be defaulted to the empty string.
