/**
 * The currency vocabulary — which currencies exist and what a player starts with — and the

 *
 * Separate from `balance-db.ts` for the same reason `catalog-load.ts` is separate from
 * `catalog-db.ts`: that module types its queries with `D1Database`, a Workers type, and the
 * `runx admin reload-plus` CLI (@repo/tools) that runs the reload is a plain Node process
 * with no such types. Nothing here imports anything, so both sides can use it; `balance-db.ts`
 * re-exports all of it, so the worker keeps importing from there.

/**
 * The currencies the client knows about (its `CurrencyType` enum, obfuscated
 * `GKPEKOLBBJL` — which lists every member below except `RoomInventoryItem`). The client sends
 * these ints in the balance/storefront paths — `/api/storefronts/v4/balance/2` is
 * RecCenterTokens — so the values are fixed by the client, not by us.
 *
 * What each one is:
 *  - `Invalid` (0): the enum's zero value. Never a real balance; a request for it is
 *    a client bug or a probe, and `isSpendable` rejects it.
 *  - `LaserTagTickets` (1): earned in the Laser Tag activity, spent in its own store.
 *  - `RecCenterTokens` (2): THE general-purpose currency — what players mean by
 *    "tokens", earned everywhere and spent in the avatar/gift-drop storefronts. This
 *    is the only one the client fetches on load, and the only one we grant at signup.
 *  - `LostSkullsGold` (100) / `DraculaSilver` (101): per-activity currencies for the
 *    Isle of Lost Skulls and Rise of Jumbo quests. Earned and spent inside those
 *    activities only.
 *  - `RecRoyaleSeason1` (200): a season currency for Rec Royale; legacy, no live faucet.
 *  - `RoomCurrency` (300) / `RoomInventoryItem` (301): NOT global balances. These are
 *    scoped to a specific room and served by the `/api/roomcurrencies/*` and
 *    `/api/roomconsumables/*` endpoints, whose rows are keyed by room as well as by
 *    account. They must never be stored in this (account, currency) table — a single
 *    row here couldn't say WHICH room's currency it is, so a player's coins in one
 *    room would spend in every other. `isSpendable` rejects them for that reason.
 *  - `ProgressionEvent` (400): an XP/progression counter the client models as a
 *    currency. Not spendable.
 *  - `RoomieCredits` (500): the newest member of the client's enum. Nothing here grants or
 *    spends it yet; it is listed so the enum matches the client's and a value arriving on
 *    the wire has a name rather than reading as an unknown number.
