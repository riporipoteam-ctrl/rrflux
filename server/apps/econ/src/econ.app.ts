/**
 * THE BALANCE-FRAME RULE, which both balance bugs came from getting wrong.
 *
 * The client holds a balance PER `(CurrencyType, Platform)` bucket and shows the SUM of the
 * buckets. Every `StorefrontBalance*` frame is an absolute SET of the one bucket it names —
 * not a change to apply — so:
 *
 *  1. `Balance` is the RESULTING TOTAL. Sending the change sets the bucket TO that change.
 *  2. The bucket key on the wire is `Platform`. The client's property is called
 *     `BalanceType` but carries a `[DataMember]` rename, and its decoder drops unknown
 *     members in silence — so a frame that says `BalanceType` lands in `Platform` 0,
 *     `SteamPurchased`, and creates a SECOND bucket that is added to the real one forever.
 *  3. That bucket must be the same one `GET /api/storefronts/v4/balance/:type` reports,
 *     `ALL_PLATFORMS`. One account-wide bucket per currency is the whole model here; a
 *     frame naming any other Platform is a phantom balance, not a per-store nicety.
 *
 * Both live bugs were rule 2 or 3, and both looked like the frame being "additive":
 *  - A player who earned 250 on 10,000 read 20,250 — `BalanceType: -2` was dropped, so the
 *    total landed in a phantom Steam bucket beside the real one.
 *  - A player who spent 900 of 17,500 read 34,100, then 33,200 once the purchase response's
 *    -900 reached the real bucket — same phantom bucket, this time from `Platform: RecNet`.
 * Neither was additivity: the totals were right, the bucket was wrong. Frames as specified
 * here are idempotent, so re-sending one or racing a `GET /balance` cannot drift the total.
 *
 * See apps/notify/src/notification-payloads.ts for the payload shapes this is recovered
 * from — the interfaces there type these calls, so a wrong key is now a build error.

 * Award the rotation's `Gift` if this player has just earned it, doing nothing otherwise.
 * Called after each completing progress report, since `updateProgress` is the only place a
 * challenge is ever finished — there is no separate claim endpoint, and the client never
 * asks for this reward.
 *
 * Earning it takes {@link challengesRequiredForGift} of the rotation's challenges, counted
 * from `challenge_status`. Only challenges the rotation still publishes count: a report can
 * carry an id this week's set no longer lists (an edited rotation under a live client), and
 * three of those shouldn't buy a gift the player never worked for.
 *
 * What lands is the `Gift` block's item — or, if the player already owns it, the box named
 * by `FallbackGiftName`, which rolls something they don't have at that tier. Finishing the
 * week can't be worth nothing, and the rotation's reward is one fixed item that plenty of
 * players will have bought already.
 *
 * A grant that throws is swallowed: the client is reporting gameplay progress, and failing
 * that report (which it would then retry with the same completion) is worse than missing
 * the reward — the claim row is already taken, so the miss is permanent but visible in the
 * logs. An empty rotation earns nothing: its threshold clamps to zero, which every player
 * would otherwise meet without playing.
