 * Durable Object hosting the SignalR notifications hub. A single global instance
 * holds the shared hub state (one process, shared across connections).
 *
 * It speaks the SignalR JSON Hub Protocol over a hibernatable WebSocket:
 *   1. negotiate happens in the worker; the client then opens a WS to `/hub/v1`.
 *   2. handshake: client sends `{"protocol":"json","version":1}␞`, we reply `{}␞`.
 *   3. framed messages are `␞` (0x1e) delimited JSON; type 1 = invocation,
 *      3 = completion, 6 = ping, 7 = close.
 *
 * Connection/subscription state lives in SQLite so it survives hibernation:
 *   - `connection_owner(connectionId, playerId)` — who each socket belongs to,
 *     from the token the worker validated at connect. This is how a player's own
 *     notifications reach them; the client never subscribes to itself.
 *   - `subscriptions(connectionId, playerId)` — *other* players a connection asked
 *     for updates about, both the connection→players and (queried the other way)
 *     the player→connections maps.
 *   - `pending(id, playerId, payload)` — the per-player queue delivered once a
 *     player is reachable again.
