 * module-level mutable state, which belongs in a module of its own rather than in
 * whichever component happened to define it first.
 *
 * The SPA calls the SAME endpoints the game does — `auth` for tokens and the password
 * change, `accounts` for the profile, `api` for the photo feed, `notify` for the admin
 * broadcasts — rather than proxying each one through `www`, exactly as rec.net's own site
 * did. Those workers answer CORS for it (see their `withDefaultCors()`), and the access
 * token lives here in the browser. `www` serves only what cannot leave the server: the
 * site config, Turnstile-gated signup, the Discord benefits claim, and the staff
 * moderation endpoints (see www.app.ts).
