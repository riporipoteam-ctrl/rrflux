 * the game does, on `auth`/`accounts`/`api`/`notify` directly, exactly as rec.net's own
 * site did. Those workers answer CORS for it, and the browser holds the access token.
 *
 * Two things stay server-side here, both because they can't work any other way:
 *
 *  - `/api/signup`, because it's gated by Turnstile and the secret key that turns a
 *    widget token into a verdict cannot ship to a browser. It's also the one account
 *    endpoint with no game equivalent — the game never creates password accounts — so
 *    there's no client contract being duplicated.
 *  - `/api/config`, which tells the SPA the Turnstile site key and where the other
 *    workers live, so one client build works for any operator's domain.
 *  - `/api/benefits/*`, the Discord-verified benefits claim, for the same reason as
 *    signup: the OAuth2 client secret that turns Discord's authorization code into an
 *    access token can't ship to a browser. It is also the only route here that writes to
 *    the database, and so the only one that verifies a token itself (see the section).
