/**
 * The staff moderation surface — the endpoints behind the `/moderation` panel in the SPA.
 *
 * These live on `www` rather than on `api` (which owns the `report` table) on purpose:
 * every other worker reimplements an endpoint the Rec Room client actually calls, and a
 * staff panel has no counterpart in the real service. Keeping recflare's own additions
 * here leaves the game-facing workers a faithful surface, with nothing in them the client
 * never asked for. So the SQL stays in `api`'s reports-db/bans-db beside the table, and
 * only the HTTP lives here.
 *
 * Where a real game service already answers the question, the SPA asks IT rather than
 * having www proxy: usernames for the ids in a report come from `accounts`'
 * `POST /account/bulk`, the same lookup the game does. This module serves only what no
 * existing endpoint does.
 *
 * Every route is gated by {@link requireStaff} — a valid token carrying `moderator` or
 * `developer`, the operator-granted roles `auth` stamps from an account's
 * isModerator/isDeveloper flags (see the admin CLI's `grant-moderator` /
 * `grant-developer`). The SPA's `isAdmin()` gate only decides what to SHOW; this is the

/**
 * Tell a player they have been banned from the GAME, and throw them out of wherever they are.

 * refuses a banned player and `moderationBlockDetails` blocks them at login, but nothing
 * revisits a session already in progress, so someone banned mid-session keeps playing.
 *
 * The frame is a `ModerationKick` (id 22) with `IsBan: true` — the frame the client's
 * moderation screen shows as a ban from the game. This is the ONE place that frame belongs: a
 * ROOM ban must never send it (`rooms` sends `IsBan: false` and is enforced by refusing the
 * room), because the client cannot tell the two apart and shows a game-wide ban screen.
 *
 * Its contents are {@link banBlockDetails} — the same `ReportCategory`, `Message` and the
 * `Duration`/`TimeoutStartedAt` pair `moderationBlockDetails` answers for this ban — so the
 * screen a player sees mid-session is the screen they see when they next sign in, not a
 * generic "banned" with no length.
 *
 * Sent to anyone ONLINE, not only to a player standing in an instance: someone in a menu is
 * as banned as someone in a room. `GameSessionId` is their instance, or 0 when they are in
 * none. EPHEMERAL, because an offline player needs no frame — they meet the same screen at
 * `moderationBlockDetails` when they next sign in — and a queued one would fire again then.
 *
 * They are moved into their own DORM rather than having their presence deleted — the same move
 * every kick makes, and the one place a banned player is still allowed to be: `match` lets them
 * matchmake there and nowhere else, which is how they reach this screen at all. Deleting the row
 * instead left the client arriving at the dorm not knowing where it was, loading it a second
 * time. The instance they were in, if any, frees a slot.
 *
 * Entirely best-effort. The ban row is already committed by the time this runs; a hub hiccup
 * or a missing presence must not fail a ban that has been handed down.
