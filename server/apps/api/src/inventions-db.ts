 * bare array — the shape the client expects from v2/search.
 *
 * `value` is split into terms on whitespace and `+`, and EVERY term must match (AND, not OR),
 * which is what makes typing more words narrow the list. Each is matched case-insensitively
 * against the NAME and the DESCRIPTION.
 *
 * Filtered, ordered and paged entirely IN SQL. It used to read every published invention into
 * memory, filter there and slice — which meant the cost of a search grew with the whole
 * catalogue no matter how narrow the query or how small the page, and a browse screen asking
 * for 100 rows paid for all of them. `Name`, `Description` and `CreatedAt` live inside the JSON
 * blob, so they are reached with `json_extract`; `is_published`/`hide_from_player` are already
 * generated columns.
 *
 * Both sides of the comparison are lowered rather than leaning on `LIKE`, which folds case for
 * ASCII only — and invention names are full of things it would not fold. `%` and `_` in a term
 * are escaped so a player searching for one finds it instead of matching everything.
 *
 * A term starting with `#` is NOT special here: the browse screen's filter chips send `#small`,
 * and a tag appears in no name or description, so those searches find nothing. Matching tags
 * needs them out of the JSON blob and into something indexable first; until then this stays a
 * text search rather than one that scans every row to look at its tags.
