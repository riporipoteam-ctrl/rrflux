 *
 * Fields are read case-insensitively because the client's own casing isn't consistent —
 * it sends `ruleset` lowercase among otherwise PascalCase keys, and a reader that trusts
 * one spelling silently ignores the other.
 *
 * `Context` ("RoomChat", and whatever else names the surface being checked), `Intent` and
 * `ruleset` are read but not acted on: they select among the reference's several
 * filtering policies and this server has one, so honouring them would mean inventing
 * differences between them. A body that isn't JSON, or carries no `Value`, reads as the
 * empty string — nothing to object to, rather than a bad request.
