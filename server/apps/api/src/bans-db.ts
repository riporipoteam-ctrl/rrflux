/**
 * Who a ban reaches — the ban itself, plus the accounts that share an identity with a
 * banned one. This is the ban-EVASION half of moderation: a ban lives on a `report` row
 * (see reports-db) and applies to one account, but a player whose account is banned can
 * make another in seconds, so the block has to follow the things that are harder to
 * change than an account: the platform identity they log in with, and the network they
 * play from.
 *
 * Three arms, in descending order of how much they prove:
 *  - ACCOUNT — the caller's own account is banned. Certain.
 *  - PLATFORM — the caller shares a `platform_account` link (a Steam or Meta identity
 *    they PROVED to us; see the auth worker's platform-db) with a banned account. Sharp:
 *    linking only ever happens off a verified proof, so this really is the same person,
 *    modulo somebody handing over their Steam account.
 *  - IP — the caller shares a `signupIp`/`lastLoginIp` with a banned account. COARSE,
 *    and the one that will produce false positives: households, NAT, campus and mobile
 *    carrier networks put many unrelated players behind one address, so this arm bans a
 *    banned player's whole household along with them. It is the operator's call whether
 *    that trade is worth it — hence `BAN_EVASION_MATCH` (see `banEvasionMatch`), which
 *    narrows or disables the linked arms without touching the direct one.
 *
 * The direct arm can never be turned off. That is the point of the split: an operator
 * dialling back evasion matching still enforces every ban they handed down.
 *
 * Reads three tables owned by three workers — `report` (api), `account` (auth, via the
 * blob) and `platform_account` (auth) — which is why this is its own module rather than
 * part of reports-db: it is the POLICY over those tables, not any one table's storage.
 * It only ever reads them.
 *
 * The whole resolution is ONE statement. The alternative — fetch my ips, fetch my links,
 * then query bans — is three round trips on a path that runs on every matchmake and every
 * token grant. Driving from the (few) banned reports and looking each one's account up by
 * its indexed id keeps the work proportional to the number of BANS, not to the number of
 * accounts.
