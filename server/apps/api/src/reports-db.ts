/**
 * Player-report storage on the shared `recflare` D1 database.
 *
 * Like the relationship table (and unlike the JSON-blob tables here — rooms /
 * accounts / image / invention), a report is genuinely columnar, so it gets a
 * normal relational table. Rows are append-only in the sense that nothing rewrites
 * what a player submitted: the table is a log of exactly what was reported.
 *
 * The `api` worker owns this schema/migration (migrations/0004_report.sql,
 * 0009_report_ban.sql, 0011_report_event.sql, 0016_report_invention.sql,
 * 0017_report_custom_avatar_item.sql, 0020_report_ban_audit.sql and
 * 0025_report_chat_message.sql, applied under its own `migrations_table` so it doesn't clash
 * with the other workers' migrations that share the database).
 *
 * The moderation-side READS here — `searchReports`, `getTopReported`, `getBansInForce` —
 * are not called by any endpoint on this worker. They back the staff panel served by
 * `www` (`/api/staff/*`), which imports them: the endpoints are a recflare addition with
 * no counterpart in the real service, and those live on `www` rather than on the workers
 * that reimplement the game's own API. The SQL stays here, with the table that owns it.
 *
 * A reported player EVENT, INVENTION or CUSTOM AVATAR ITEM lands here too, rather than in a
 * table of its own: same fields, same moderation life. Such a row carries `event_id`,
 * `invention_id` or `custom_avatar_item_id`, and its `reported_player_id` is that thing's
 * CREATOR — see `POST /api/playerevents/v1/report`, `POST /api/inventions/v1/report` and
 * `POST /api/customAvatarItems/v1/{id}/report`. A reported CHAT MESSAGE is the fourth kind:
 * `chat_message_id`, with the message's SENDER as the reported player — see
 * `POST /api/chatreport/createChatReport`. The four id columns are mutually exclusive; a row
 * with none of them is an ordinary player report. They are separate columns rather than one
 * polymorphic id because the keys differ in TYPE (numbers and a guid) and in what they key.
 *
 * A report is also where an ACCOUNT-WIDE ban lives: acting on a report sets `banned`
 * on that same row (see `banFromReport`), so the ban carries the evidence for it. It is
 * ENFORCED by `match`, which refuses every matchmake for a banned player, and DESCRIBED
 * by `/api/PlayerReporting/v1/moderationBlockDetails`, which tells the banned player why
 * (via `getActiveBan`). `auth` still issues a banned account a token — that is what lets
 * the client reach the block screen — and reads this table only for ban EVASION (an
 * account sharing a device or network with a banned one; see bans-db). This is distinct
 * from the per-room `room_ban` table the rooms worker owns: that one keeps a player out
 * of ONE room, this one out of the game.

 *
 * None of `event_id`, `invention_id`, `custom_avatar_item_id` or `chat_message_id` is
 * indexed: each is written on every report of its kind and read by nothing — no query here filters on any of them,
