/**
 * Player reputation — the cheer counters on a profile — and the daily cheer credit that
 * pays for handing one out, on the shared `recflare` D1 database.
 *
 * Two tables, because they answer two different questions:
 *
 * - `reputation` is what a player has RECEIVED: one counter per cheer category, plus the
 *   assorted profile numbers the DTO carries. One row per account, created the first time
 *   somebody cheers them — a missing row means "nobody has cheered them yet", which is
 *   exactly the all-zero default the reputation endpoints already served, so reads fall
 *   back to it rather than inserting on a GET.
 * - `player_cheer` is what a player has left to GIVE: a credit that refills to
 *   {@link DAILY_CHEER_CREDIT} once the window in `created` is a day old. One row per
 *   account, created the first time they spend one.
 *
 * One of the client's fields is deliberately NOT a column. `CheerCredit` sits alongside
 * the counters in the client's record but is `player_cheer.cheers_left` with the rollover
 * applied — storing it twice would let the number a player reads drift from the one the
 * spend checks. `SelectedCheer` (the cheer pinned to the profile, set by
 * `POST /api/PlayerCheer/v1/SetSelectedCheer`) and `IsCheerful` (a profile flag every
 * reference serves as true) ARE columns, added in 0014 — the `ReputationUpdate` frame is
 * the record trimmed, nothing more, so both come off the row.
 *
 * The `api` worker owns the schema/migrations (migrations/0013_reputation.sql and
 * 0014_reputation_selected_cheer.sql, applied under its own `migrations_table` so they
 * don't clash with the other workers' migrations that share the database).
