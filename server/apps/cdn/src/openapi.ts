 * generate the spec and are never wired into `hono-openapi`'s `validator()`. Same
 * rationale as the auth/accounts/img workers: a reverse-engineered protocol, lenient
 * handlers, no runtime validation.
 *
 * Do NOT add `.meta({ id })` to these schemas — with this hono-openapi + zod v4 setup a
 * meta'd schema used in a response emits a `$ref` the framework doesn't always hoist
 * into `components.schemas`, leaving a dangling reference. Leaving meta off makes every
 * schema inline, which renders correctly in any tool.
 *
 * Most of this worker's surface is opaque BYTES, not JSON, so those responses are
 * described with a binary content type rather than a zod schema (the same way the `img`
 * worker describes image bytes).
