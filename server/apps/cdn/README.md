# cdn

CDN Worker served on the `cdn` subdomain (`cdn.recflare.net`) — a Hono app that streams
the binary blobs the client downloads while playing out of the shared
Firestore-backed blob store (collection `flux_blobs`, namespace `CDN_ASSETS`),
plus the JSON config files the client reads from `/config/`.

`/config/:name` serves `static/config/<name>.json` verbatim — `RRPlusConfig_v3` and
`SkuConfig_v1` today — with or without the `.json` in the path, since the game configs that
point at these files carry the extension and the client's older config calls don't. `{name}`
IS the filename: that directory is uploaded as Workers static assets and read through the
ASSETS binding, so publishing a config is dropping in a file, and `run_worker_first` keeps
the asset server from answering ahead of the Worker (nothing is reachable at its own asset
path). The files go out byte-for-byte, BOM included. `/config/LoadingScreenTipData` stays a
route of its own, bundled rather than an asset, because its file is named differently from
its path.

Objects are keyed by prefix — `sigs/` (anti-cheat signatures), `room/` (saved room
scenes, and room images by their bare `ImageName`), `invention/` (invention data), `data/`
(generic client uploads), `avatar/` (custom avatar item assetbundles) — and served as `application/octet-stream`; the worker never interprets what it hands back.
Reads are unauthenticated: a caller needs the exact key, which only comes from an
authenticated call to another worker.

This worker only reads. Uploads go through `storage`, which writes the same blob
store, and
images are served by `img`.

## API documentation

`GET /openapi.json` serves a spec generated from `describeRoute` blocks that sit
alongside each handler, with the schemas in `src/openapi.ts`. It's also aggregated into
the docs page www serves at `/docs`.

**The spec is descriptive, not enforced** — same rationale as the `img`/`auth` workers: a
reverse-engineered protocol, lenient handlers, no runtime validation. A test asserts
every route appears in the spec, so adding one without documenting it fails.

## Conditional and range requests

Every asset route honours `If-None-Match` (→ 304) and a single `Range` (→ 206). The range
support is not an optimization: large-file downloaders fetch in chunks, and answering 200
where a 206 is expected corrupts the reassembled file — which surfaces as an anti-cheat
"Signatures don't match" failure rather than a download error.
