 *
 * Two workers share it, so it lives here rather than in either: `econ` WRITES it (game
 * rewards pay XP out) and `api` READS it (`GET /api/players/v{1,2}/progression/…`). Same
 * split as the gift boxes next door.
 *
 * A missing row is not an error — it means "nothing earned yet", which is exactly the
 * level-1/0-XP default the progression endpoints already served, so reads fall back to it
 * rather than inserting on a GET.
 *
 * `level` is stored rather than derived, because `xp` is NOT lifetime XP: a level-up spends
 * the tier's cost out of it (see {@link LEVEL_REQUIRED_XP}), so the pair is a level plus the
 * progress into the next one — which is exactly what the client's bar draws.
 *
 * The `econ` worker owns the migration (apps/econ/migrations/0012_progression.sql), being
 * the writer.
