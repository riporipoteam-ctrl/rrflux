 *
 * A plain `as const` object rather than an `enum` like its neighbours, and deliberately
 * so: `auth` builds `PlatformTypeSchema`'s description by walking `Object.entries`, and a
 * numeric TS enum also emits a REVERSE mapping (`{ '0': 'Steam', Steam: 0, … }`), which
 * would double every member in the generated spec.
 *
 * Everything from `Steam` to `Pico` is a real Rec Room client platform, numbered by the
 * client. `Discord` is OURS — it is not a platform anyone signs in from, and the client
 * never sends it. It exists so a verified Discord identity can be stored as an account
 * link like any other external identity (see `auth`'s platform-db and the website's
 * benefits claim); it sits at 101, well clear of the client's range, so a future client
 * platform can be added without colliding with it.
