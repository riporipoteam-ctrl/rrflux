/**
 * Room invites on the shared `recflare` D1 database — one row per game invite a player
 * sends another ("come join me in this room"), as `POST /invite` on the `match` worker
 * creates them.
 *
 * The invite that reaches the invitee is a live notification, not a row: `match` pushes a
 * `MessageReceived` frame the moment the invite is created, and the client renders the join
 * prompt straight off it. This table exists so the invite has an ID OF ITS OWN —
 * `RoomInviteId`, which the create response hands back — and so an invite can be looked up
 * or expired after the fact rather than vanishing with the socket frame.
 *
 * The `match` worker owns this schema/migration
 * (`apps/match/migrations/0001_room_invite.sql`, applied under its own `migrations_table`
 * so it doesn't clash with the other workers' migrations that share the database).
 * `ROOM_INVITE_SCHEMA_DDL` mirrors that migration so tests can build the table directly.
