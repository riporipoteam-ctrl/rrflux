/**
 * Stored notifications on the shared `recflare` D1 database — one row per notification a
 * player has been sent, as `GET /api/messages/v2/get` serves them back on login.
 *
 * A notification is a WebSocket push, and this table is the delayed half of one. The live
 * half is the `MessageReceived` frame the hub pushes, and for a long time it was the ONLY
 * half: the inbox endpoint answered an empty list unconditionally, so anything sent to an
 * offline player existed solely as a queued frame in the hub's Durable Object. That queue is
 * best-effort by construction — dropped once sent rather than acked, bounded per player, and
 * skipped entirely whenever the hub believes it delivered (a socket the client has already
 * abandoned still counts as a delivery) — so a push could be lost with nothing left to show
 * it ever existed. A row here outlives all of that: the player reads it on next login
 * whether or not the socket ever carried it.
 *
 * The two halves are tied together by the ID. A stored notification's `Id` is the id carried
 * on the frame that delivers it, so the client can recognise the push it received as the one
 * it then reads from the inbox, and `POST /api/messages/v3/delete` has an id to match. A
 * sender therefore WRITES THE ROW FIRST and builds its frame from the returned record —
 * never the other way round, and never with an id of its own invention.
 *
 * Not everything pushed belongs here. Only what is still worth reading LATER: a direct
 * message, a room-role invite, a coach message to one player. A broadcast (a maintenance
 * notice to everyone online at once) would be a row per player for something nobody re-reads;
 * a vote-to-kick prompt is about a session that has since ended; a cheer already has its
 * durable record in the `reputation` counters.
 *
 * The table is `notification`, NOT `message`: the `chat` worker already owns a `message`
 * table on this same shared database (its thread posts, a different thing entirely). The two
 * were distinguishable only by name, and `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` against a name that is
 * already taken does nothing and says nothing — so the first version of this migration
 * quietly adopted chat's table and failed only one statement later, on an index naming a
 * column that table doesn't have. Every worker here shares one database; check a table name
 * against the whole repo before taking it.
 *
 * The `api` worker owns this schema/migration (`apps/api/migrations/0019_notification.sql`,
 * applied under its own `migrations_table` so it doesn't clash with the other workers'
 * migrations that share the database). `NOTIFICATION_SCHEMA_DDL` mirrors that migration so
 * tests can build the table directly.

/**
 * How many stored notifications one player keeps, newest-wins.
 *
 * Bounded for the same reason the hub's pending queue is: an inbox nothing ever deletes grows
 * with every notification the server sends, and the read then loads the lot. The client shows
 * an inbox rather than an archive, and a player returning to a screenful of them is served no
 * better by the one below it.
