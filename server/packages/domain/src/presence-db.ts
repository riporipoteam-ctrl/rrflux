/**
 * Player presence — the room instance a player is currently in, plus the status
 * fields the match heartbeat echoes back. Stored on the shared `recflare` D1 with
 * the same JSON-blob pattern as the rooms/room_instance tables: the full presence
 * is a JSON blob in `data`, and the fields we query on (account_id,
 * room_instance_id, room_id, expires_at) are SQLite generated (virtual) columns
 * extracted from it. One row per account (unique `account_id`); writes upsert via
 * `INSERT OR REPLACE`.
 *
 * The `match` worker owns presence — written on matchmake/heartbeat, read by the
 * heartbeat and the batch `/player` lookup. The `auth` worker seeds it for new
 * players (Orientation) and the `rooms` worker reads it (Photon access token). All
 * three import these helpers from `@repo/domain`; the `rooms` worker owns the
 * schema (migrations/0006_presence.sql).
 *
 * This replaces the old match-presence KV. D1 gives strong reads (no cross-PoP
 * staleness that would read presence as out-of-sync and bounce the player), a
 * single-query batch lookup for `/player`, and lets matchmaking count players per
 * instance (see {@link countPlayersInInstance}). Rows carry an absolute
 * `expiresAt` (epoch seconds); reads filter expired rows out and
 * {@link deleteExpiredPresence} purges them.
