/**
 * Room storage on the shared `recflare` D1 database. Each room is a single JSON
 * blob in the `data` column; queryable fields (RoomId, Name, CreatorAccountId,
 * IsDorm) are SQLite generated (virtual) columns extracted from that JSON and
 * indexed. This keeps the room shape flexible while still allowing fast lookups
 * by id/name/creator — the same JSON-blob pattern `accounts-db` uses.
 *
 * `ROOM_SCHEMA_DDL` mirrors the head schema after all migrations (`0001_init.sql`
 * created the table as `rooms`; `0005_rename_room.sql` renamed it to `room`); the
 * room data is seeded from `apps/rooms/static/ImportRooms.json` by
 * `migrations/0002_import_rooms.sql`. Tests apply `ROOM_SCHEMA_DDL` then seed the
 * imported rooms directly.
 *
 * This module is the single source of truth for the helpers: the `rooms` worker
 * (which owns the schema/migrations) uses the read/write set; the `match` worker
 * uses the room lookups plus the dorm helpers; the `api` worker binds the same
 * database read-only and uses `getRoomById`. Each imports the subset it needs.

 * nothing should not exist, so a revoke removes the record.
 *
 * Two entries are protected, and both refuse by returning null without writing:
 *
 *  - The room's OWNER — `CreatorAccountId`, or a {@link Role.Creator} entry. Ownership is not
 *    a role to be taken away by anyone standing beside it; it moves through
 *    {@link transferRoomOwnership} and nowhere else. Without this a co-owner could remove the
 *    creator's entry, and on an older room whose creator has no entry at all they could not —
 *    so the check is on `CreatorAccountId` as well as on the tier.
 *  - A CO-OWNER entry, unless the caller is the room's owner. Co-owners are peers: letting one
 *    remove another means whichever of them asks first wins, and the room's owner is the only
 *    person who is not a peer of theirs. A co-owner may still revoke the helper tiers.
 *
 * Removing a role a player does not have is NOT a failure — the room comes back unchanged and
 * nothing is written. The caller asked for this player to hold no role, and they hold none;
 * answering an error would make a client retrying a removal look broken.
 *
 * Takes any pending `InvitedRole` with it, since the whole entry goes. That is the same
 * trade {@link answerRoomRoleInvite} makes when declining, and it means revoking a role from
 * someone who has a co-owner invite standing also withdraws the invite.
 *
 * `removedByAccountId` is not stamped anywhere — the entry it would be stamped on is the one
