/**
 * The Flux Social global photo feed — the newest ShareCamera photos the caller
 * may see, newest first, paginated via skip/take.
 *
 * Audience is enforced in SQL so pagination stays correct:
 * - public photos (Accessibility 1): everyone, including anonymous callers
 * - friends-visible (Accessibility 2): only the caller's friends (and the
 *   photographer themselves, via the `player_id = caller` arm)
 * - private (Accessibility 0): only the photographer
 * - anonymous callers see public photos only
 *
 * Only ShareCamera images (Type 1) are surfaced — not room/profile/invention
 * thumbnails. A photographer's Flux Social privacy toggle
 * (`flux_social_privacy.show_photos = 0`) hides their photos from everyone but
 * themselves; it is applied after the SQL pass over a small over-fetch, since
 * hidden rows are rare. Each row is joined to the photographer's username and
 * (if any) the room's name in two batched lookups, like the slideshow feed.
