/**
 * Received gifts — the "gift boxes" a player is handed on the shared `recflare` D1.
 * A box is created when a player buys a storefront item (for themselves or as a
 * gift) and lingers until the client opens it. Opening GRANTS the box's contents:
 * the item/equipment/consumable the box carries is written into the player's
 * inventory by the open itself, exactly once (the delete and the grants commit in
 * one D1 transaction, so a racing double-open can't grant twice).
 *
 * Boxes written before open-to-grant keep the old semantics — their contents were
 * granted at creation, so opening one only deletes the row. They carry no
 * `GrantOnOpen` marker; every box written with the marker grants on open.
 *
 * The `econ` worker owns the schema/migration (apps/econ/migrations/
 * 0003_received_gift.sql) and is the only writer: `POST /api/storefronts/v2/buyItem`
 * inserts a box and `GET /api/avatar/v2/gifts` lists a player's pending boxes. The
 * `api` worker only deletes, from `POST /api/avatar/v2/gifts/consume`. Both import
 * these helpers so the table name and row shape live in one place.
 *
 * One row per gift box. `data` is the box's rendered content as an opaque JSON blob
 * (the currency/avatar-item fields the client draws); `id` and `created_at` are
 * columns so a box can be listed and deleted by id without parsing the blob.
