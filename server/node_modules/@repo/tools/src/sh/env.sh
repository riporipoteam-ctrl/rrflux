# and `just dev`, so a value is never configured twice.

# Names the deploy scripts consume themselves — the domain and the ids of the operator's
# Cloudflare resources. Everything else in .env is worker config; see recflare_vars.

# Echo the `--var` flags carrying the operator's tuning knobs, e.g.
# " --var MAX_ACCOUNTS_PER_IP:10 --var STARTING_TOKENS:250".
#
# This is a convention, not a list kept here: every RECFLARE_<VAR> in the environment that
# isn't one of the RECFLARE_RESERVED deploy inputs above is handed to the worker as
# `--var <VAR>:<value>`. So RECFLARE_MAX_ACCOUNTS_PER_IP=10 gives every worker
# MAX_ACCOUNTS_PER_IP=10 — the workers that don't read it simply ignore it, and two workers
# that read the same knob agree on it for free. Adding a knob means declaring it in the
# worker's context.ts, reading it there, and documenting it in .env.example; these scripts
# never need to change and stay free of any knowledge of specific app names.
#
# Every knob is optional: unset means no `--var` at all, so the worker falls back to the
# default constant in its own source, and deleting a line from .env really does restore that
# default on the next deploy. (Vars are replaced wholesale by a deploy — which is exactly
# why a value set in the Cloudflare dashboard doesn't survive one.)
#
# Values must not contain whitespace: the result is a flag list the caller word-splits.
# Knobs are numbers and short unquoted strings (`2=MyHub`), and real secrets belong in the
# Secrets Store (which is bound in wrangler.jsonc, not passed through here), so this hasn't
# been worth the ceremony of an array. Vars also arrive in the Worker as strings (`--var
# X:3` is "3", not 3), which is why a numeric knob is parsed through `intVar` rather than
# read as a number.
