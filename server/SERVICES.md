# Services

This is a list of every RecNet service the client discovers, taken from the
service-discovery map in [`apps/ns/src/endpoints.ts`](apps/ns/src/endpoints.ts).
Each is reached at `https://<subdomain>.<your-domain>`. Services with a worker in
`apps/` are implemented here; the rest are advertised in the endpoints document
but not yet backed by a Worker. Not all services are fully implemented.

The subdomains below are the defaults. Any of them can be redirected from `.env` via
`RECFLARE_SUBDOMAINS`, keyed by the subdomain in this table — which both moves where the
worker deploys and what `ns` advertises. Pointing one service at another merges them, e.g.
`'{"moderation":"api"}'` sends the client's Moderation calls to the `api` worker, where the
`/api/PlayerReporting/…` routes already live. See `DEPLOYING.md`.

That override is still the one to set for Moderation: the `moderation` worker deploys but
is a stub, so with no override the client's reporting calls reach it and 404 rather than
reaching the routes in `api`. Drop the override once `moderation` serves them itself.

A small `ns` worker itself serves this discovery document at the
apex/`ns` host and isn't listed within it. Each implemented worker has its own
`README.md` under `apps/<name>/` documenting its routes.
