# RecNet Plugin

A [BepInEx 6](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) (IL2CPP) plugin that points the Rec Room client at a self-hosted / private server.

It does this entirely client-side with [Harmony](https://harmony.pardeike.net/) patches — no game files are modified on disk. The plugin rewrites the RecNet name-server lookups, swaps in your own Photon credentials, and disables the client-side guards (EasyAntiCheat, TLS certificate pinning, image signature verification) that would otherwise reject a non-official server.

> ⚠️ This disables anti-cheat, certificate validation, and RSA signature verification on the client. Use at your own risk.

This plugin powers [RecFlare](https://www.recflare.net) - an open source, cloud-native Rec Room server.

## Safety

Using BepInEx plugins may cause anti-virus scanners or Windows Defender to pick it up as a threat.

If you don't trust the compiled .DLL, you can build it yourself.

## What it does

| Patch | File | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Name-server redirect | `Patches/SendRequestPatch.cs` | Intercepts `BestHTTP` requests and rewrites the host `ns.rec.net` → your configured server. Also provides optional HTTP request/response logging for development. |
| Photon override | `Patches/PhotonPatches.cs` | Replaces the Realtime / Voice / Chat App IDs (and optionally the Photon name server + port) with your own. |
| EAC bypass | `Patches/EACPatches.cs` | Forces EasyAntiCheat "ready" and stubs the challenge-response so the client connects without the official anti-cheat. |
| TLS bypass | `Patches/DisableTLSPinning.cs` | Skips server-certificate validation so a custom server's cert is accepted. |
| Image signing bypass | `Patches/ImageSigningPatch.cs` | Forces the mscorlib RSA verify to succeed, so images your server serves load without being signed by Rec Room's key. **On by default.** |
| CheatManager handling | `Plugin.cs` | Deactivates the in-game `CheatManager` (which would otherwise boot you from rooms) while keeping it resolvable for account creation / login. |
| DUID mismatch workaround | `Patches/DUIDMismatchPatch.cs` | Forces the device-id mismatch check to "no mismatch" so the Create Account hang (below) is skipped. **On by default**; no-op on healthy machines. |
| DUID diagnostics | `Patches/DUIDProbePatch.cs`, `Patches/CorruptDUIDPatch.cs`, `Patches/DeviceIdResponsePatch.cs` | Investigation tooling for the hang: PlayerPrefs/DUID call logging, deliberately corrupting or restoring the stored id, and rewriting the `deviceId` response in flight. All off by default — see [Configuration](#configuration). |
| New Watch UI | `Patches/WatchUIPatch.cs` | Forces the 2023 client's new Watch UI (RRUI) on by forcing its Statsig gate getters (`get_UseRRUIHomeScreen`, `get_UseNewWatchArchitecture`, `get_UseRRUINotificationsScreen`, `get_UseRRUIEventsScreen`, `get_UseRRUIPeopleScreen`) to true. The client fetches Statsig gates directly from statsigapi.net — not from our backend — so without this it always renders the legacy watch. **On by default**; set false to fall back to the legacy watch. |

## The Create Account / DUID hang

Some machines hang forever on **Create Account**. This turned out to be a genuinely nasty one, so it's
worth documenting.

**What happens:** when the client's *stored* device id (DUID) differs from the one derived at runtime,
the client takes a "migration" path — it POSTs to `PlayerReporting/v1/deviceId`, the server answers
`200 {"success":true}`, and then the client **stalls**: it never makes the `create_account` OAuth call
and never persists the new id. Machines whose stored id already matches never take this path, which is
why the bug hits some players and not others (and is hard to reproduce if your own machine is fine).

**The decision point** is `CheatManager.CheckForDUIDMismatch`. Forcing it to return *true* reproduces
the hang on any machine; forcing it *false* skips the whole path. That false-forcing is the shipping
workaround, exposed as the `Suppress DUID Mismatch` config option, which is **on by default**. It's a
no-op on healthy machines (their real check already returns false) and skips the hang on affected ones.

**Still unsolved:** we have not found where the "old" device id in that POST actually comes from. It
survives deleting the entire `HKCU\Software\Against Gravity\Rec Room` registry key, and on the failing
run the local `cm_did_ppk` PlayerPref is never even read — so clearing local storage does **not** fix
it. The leading theory is that it's held server-side (recorded by the server from earlier reports)
and/or cached in memory from a server response, which would make the proper fix server-side. See
`CLAUDE.md` for the full investigation and the diagnostic tooling.

> ⚠️ `Suppress DUID Mismatch` is a workaround: it lets account creation through but does **not** repair
> a genuinely corrupt stored/served id — it just stops the client from acting on the mismatch.

## Requirements

- A Rec Room install set up with **BepInEx 6 (IL2CPP, bleeding-edge)**, launched at least once so the IL2CPP interop assemblies have been generated under `BepInEx/interop/`.
- **.NET 6 SDK** to build the plugin.
- Your own server endpoints: a RecNet name server, and [Photon](https://www.photonengine.com) app keys.

## Installing

1. Download the game using https://github.com/SteamRE/DepotDownloader. The manifest ID is `6426603215211043630` (the **20230414** build).
   Example: `depotdownloader -app 471710 -depot 471711 -manifest 6426603215211043630`
   **You must use this specific version.** Rec Room's type and method names are obfuscated and
   re-rolled every build, so the patches only bind against the build they were written for.
2. Install BepInEx to the game. See https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html. **Note that you must use version 6!**
3. Launch the game once so BepInEx generates its `config/` folder and the IL2CPP interop assemblies.

Alternatively, use the [RecFlare client](https://github.com/djdevin/recflare-client)

### From release

1. Download a release from [Releases](https://github.com/djdevin/recnet-plugin/releases)
2. Drop the `.dll` file into `BepInEx/plugins/`

### From source

The project references the game's interop DLLs, so the build needs to know where your Rec Room install lives. Set `GamePath` using any one of:

1. **A local props file** (recommended):
   ```sh
   cp GamePath.props.example GamePath.props
   ```
   then edit `GamePath` in `GamePath.props` to point at your Rec Room install root. This file is local-only and stays out of the repo.

2. **An environment variable:**
   ```sh
   set RECROOM_PATH=C:\Path\To\RecRoom        # cmd
   $env:RECROOM_PATH = "C:\Path\To\RecRoom"   # PowerShell
   ```

3. **On the command line:**
   ```sh
   dotnet build -p:GamePath="C:\Path\To\RecRoom"
   ```

Then build:

```sh
dotnet build
```

The build validates that `GamePath` is set and that `$(GamePath)\BepInEx\interop` exists, and fails with a clear message otherwise.

A post-build step (the `DeployPlugin` target in the `.csproj`) automatically copies the built `RecNetPlugin.dll` into your Rec Room install's `BepInEx/plugins/` folder after every build. (The copy will fail if Rec Room is running, since the DLL is locked — close the game and rebuild.) Since `GamePath` already points at your install, you don't need to copy anything by hand — just `dotnet build` and launch the game.

If you need the DLL elsewhere, it's also left in `bin/Debug/net6.0/`.

## Configuration

Start the game for the first time. In `BepInEx` you should now see a `config` folder. If not, verify BepInEx installation and version.

Inside `config`, edit the `net.rec.plugin.cfg` file and update as needed:

**[Server]**
- `RecNet NameServer Host` — base URL of your RecNet name server (like `https://ns.rec.net`).

**[Photon]**
- `App Id Realtime` — Photon Realtime App ID.
- `App Id Voice` — Photon Voice App ID.
- `App Id Chat` — Photon Chat App ID.

**[Signing]**
- `Disable Signature Verification` — stops the client checking that images are signed with Rec Room's
  private key, so your own server can serve images. **On by default**; leave it alone.
  > ⚠️ This forces **all** mscorlib RSA verification to pass, not just image signatures. TLS is
  > unaffected (BestHTTP uses its own bundled BouncyCastle).

**[Advanced]**
- `Enabled Advanced Settings` — must be `true` to apply the custom Photon name server / port below.
- `Photon NameServer` — custom Photon name server host.
- `Photon NameServer Port` — custom port (`0` uses the default, `4533`).
- `Debug` — verbose HTTP request/response logging (only needed for development)
  > ⚠️ Debug logs include **sensitive data** (passwords, auth tokens). Be careful when sharing them.
- `Suppress DUID Mismatch` — skips the Create Account / DUID hang (see above). **On by default**; the
  only DUID option meant for normal use. Set `false` only to observe the real mismatch for debugging.

The remaining `[Advanced]` DUID options — `Simulate DUID Mismatch`, `Corrupt Stored DUID`,
`Restore Stored DUID`, `DeviceId Response Override`, `DeviceId Response Status` — are **diagnostic
tools** used to investigate the hang. Leave them at their defaults unless you're debugging it; see
`CLAUDE.md` for what each one does.
