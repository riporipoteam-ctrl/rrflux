// Unity's own telemetry — the uploads to perf-events.cloud.unity3d.com.
//
// !! THIS DOES NOT WORK on the 20230414 build, and that is a known, accepted limitation — don't spend
// another afternoon on it. Confirmed at runtime: the setters below are refused, `enabled` reads back
// True on all five attempts, and perf-events uploads keep flowing. It's left in because it costs
// nothing, is the correct thing to do if a future build stops refusing, and the read-back logs the
// truth either way rather than pretending. The parts of `Disable Telemetry` that carry the actual win
// are Amplitude, the collector and Backtrace — all confirmed dropping — and they take out the bulk of
// the noise. If perf-events ever has to go for real, it needs a hosts-file/DNS block or a native hook;
// there is no managed lever.
//
// There is nothing to hook here, and that's the point: `UnityEngine.Analytics.Analytics` and
// `PerformanceReporting` are thin managed shims over native engine code, and the uploads happen inside
// the player, not on any managed send path a Harmony prefix could sit on. Blocking this one at the HTTP
// layer is equally hopeless — it never touches BestHTTP or UnityWebRequest. What it *does* have is a
// documented opt-out, so we flip the switches at startup and read them back.
//
// Performance Reporting is the exception/crash reporter, Analytics is the event stream; both feed
// perf-events, so both go off. `limitUserTracking` and `deviceStatsEnabled` cover the case where
// something re-enables the event stream behind our back — with those set, what it can collect is
// nothing worth sending.
