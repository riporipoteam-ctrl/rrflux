// Amplitude analytics: the client ships telemetry to Amplitude, which a self-hosted setup has no use
// for (and which leaks play data off-box). Prefix every event-logging entrypoint and swallow the call
// so nothing is ever queued, batched or sent.
//
// One knob for all telemetry, `[Analytics] Disable Telemetry`, default true — it gates this file plus
// BacktracePatch and UnityTelemetryPatch. Deliberately not split per vendor: nobody wants Amplitude
// gone but the collector alive, and four switches for one intention is four ways to be half-configured.
//
// Target resolution: AmplitudeAnalytics.AmplitudeAnalyticsClient in RecRoom.Analytics.Runtime.dll,
// concrete (it derives from SingletonMonoBehaviour<T>, so there is no abstract-interface dispatch
// trap here — see gotcha 3 in CLAUDE.md). All five Log* names are UNobfuscated in the 20230414 build.
// They are still strings, so a rename shows up only as a HarmonyX "Could not find method" in
// LogOutput.log, not as a build error — the per-method [AMPLITUDE] blocked log line below is the real
// proof a hook is live.
//
// Why all five: blocking LogEventAsync alone was not enough — a session's room_stats/perf_stats
// events still went out, and the LogEventAsync prefix never logged at all, so that entrypoint was
// never even called. Those events are the pre-serialized batch the client parks in the
// `pending_room_stats` PlayerPref (visible in the DUID-PROBE log), which points at
// LogSerializedEventAsync rather than LogEventAsync.
//
// Why the Log* prefixes alone STILL are not enough — and why `BlockAnalyticsUploadPatch` below is the
// part that actually stops the traffic: uploads to api2.amplitude.com kept showing up in mitmproxy
// with LogEventAsync/LogIdentifyAsync visibly blocked in LogOutput.log. The Log* methods only *queue*;
// the queue is persisted (`pending_room_stats`) and drained later by the client's own flush coroutines
// (Flush / AMEAMPDLJPN / PPOCFIHNKPP), which reach the network through the transport interface
// `FOMPBHDLPDO` — concrete impl `MHBPNDOGOLG` in RecNet.Runtime.dll, i.e. BestHTTP. So a batch queued
// in an earlier session ships on the next launch no matter what we do to the Log* doors. Blocking at
// the BestHTTP layer catches every path, present and future, and costs no obfuscated names.
